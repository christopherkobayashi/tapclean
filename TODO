 - Make some templates for the xxx_search() and xxx_describe() functions.
 - FIX xxx_search() functions by checking the return value from addblockdef() before assigning 'eof' to 'i'.
 - Fix long / int usage in crc32.c.
    This is not a problem with gcc, but with MS Visual C++ that assumes that
    the size for int and long (4 bytes) are different
   Or replace it with SHA256 as crc32 is not safe
 - Check for memory and filehandle leaks (error handling).
   Partly done.
 - Add a portable strupr function for sort_list in filesearch.c.
   Use strcasecmp instead?
   strupr from Peter Karlsson
     #include <ctype.h>		/* toupper() */                 
     void strupr(char *s)
     {
             do {
                     *s = toupper(*s);
                } while(*s++);
     }
 - Add warning about Gremlin Fastload (if we add that loader)
   Only clean those if you know what you are doing.
   Certain pulses can be misdetected/converted.
 - Split the code into more manageable parts
   Much of this is now done.
 - Make the code more generic
 - Add support for vic20 and Plus4 tapes
 - Add support for NTSC?
 - Check start/end pilot/data/trailer:
   SLC says:
   Example from tcreport.txt: Location: $A726 -> $AF33 -> $75C9B -> $76491
   The first points to the first pulse in the file (usually pilot).
   The second as you know points to the first datapulse.
   The third one points to the first pulse of the last byte..
   this is usually a checkbyte, but in the case it's NOT,
   it's pointing to the first pulse of the last databyte
   This you also needs to compensate for when calculating the crc32 and
   extracts data and also when counting trailers.
   And the last value points to the very last pulse in a file, that being
   last pulse of a databyte, checkbyte or just a trailer.
   CHECK: ODEload + Cult
   Probably check ALL loaders....

 - Use dynamic memory allocation for file/dir names where possible.
 - Avoid hardcoded values as much as possible, use #define.
 - Use "static" and "const" keyword usage where possible.
   Much is done.
 - Use the getcwd(buffer, size) call with buffer initialized to NULL and 
   size to -1, which should be memory safe. Then allocate a new string 
   whose size is buffer size + 2 to append SLASH and a '\0'. Strcpy and then
   free the first one.
 - Get rid of most #ifdef WIN32 stuff.
   We need to handle both windows and linux(unix), but #ifdefs are ugly.
   Keep to a bare minimum.
   Mostly done.
 - Do some major rewrite of scanners/*.
   There are WAY TOO MUCH duplication of code.
 - Unify scanner/loader names/strings
