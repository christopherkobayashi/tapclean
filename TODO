 - Fix long / int usage in crc32.c.
   Or replace it with SHA256 as crc32 is not safe
 - Check for memory and filehandle leaks (error handling).
 - Add a portable strupr function for sort_list in filesearch.c.
   Use strcasecmp instead?
 - Add warning about Gremlin Fastload (if we add that loader)
   Only clean those if you know what you are doing.
   Certain pulses can be misdetected/converted.
 - Split the code into more manageable parts
 - Make the code more generic
 - Add support for vic20 and Plus4 tapes
 - Check start/end pilot/data/trailer:
   SLC says:
   Example from tcreport.txt: Location: $A726 -> $AF33 -> $75C9B -> $76491
   The first points to the first pulse in the file (usually pilot).
   The second as you know points to the first datapulse.
   The third one points to the first pulse of the last byte..
   this is usually a checkbyte, but in the case it's NOT,
   it's pointing to the first pulse of the last databyte
   This you also needs to compensate for when calculating the crc32 and
   extracts data and also when counting trailers.
   And the last value points to the very last pulse in a file, that being
   last pulse of a databyte, checkbyte or just a trailer.
