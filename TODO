 - Fix long / int usage in crc32.c.
   Or replace it with SHA256 as crc32 is not safe
 - Check for memory and filehandle leaks (error handling).
 - Add a portable strupr function for sort_list in filesearch.c.
   Use strcasecmp instead?
 - Add warning about Gremlin Fastload (if we add that loader)
   Only clean those if you know what you are doing.
   Certain pulses can be misdetected/converted.
 - Split the code into more manageable parts
 - Make the code more generic
 - Add support for vic20 and Plus4 tapes
