v0.04
	Files changed: batchscan.c, database.c, main.c, mydefs.h.

	Converted "opname" in main.c/main() to a char *. No memory usage and no strcpy anymore (luigi).
	Fixed "opnames[12][32]" that contains just 11 entries by converting it to "opnames[][32]" (luigi).
	Removed duplicated initialization of "tol" and "debug" inside main.c/main(). They are akready
	 initialized outside main() (luigi).
	Fixed "create_database()" call in main.c/main() which was not checking for the return value (luigi).
	Added a freeing of allocated resources in database.c/create_database() in case of malloc() failure (luigi).
	Fixed wav_write() call in main.c/main() which was called using the au filename (luigi).
	Removed usage of "temptcreportname". Probably just useful in the GUI version of Final Tap (luigi).
	Converted "tcreportname", "tcbatchreportname", "temptcbatchreportname", "tcinfoname", "auoutname", 
	 and "wavoutname" in main.c to static const char (luigi).
	Converted "cleanedtapname" in main.c to static char (luigi).
	Removed "tcreportname", "tcbatchreportname", "temptcbatchreportname", "tcinfoname", "auoutname", 
	 "wavoutname", and "cleanedtapname" from mydefs.h. Just "exedir" (non-static) was kept (luigi).
	Removed duplicated BLKMAX, DBERR, and DBFULL #definitions from mydefs.h (luigi).
	Added MAXPATH #definition in mydefs.h for strings holding path and some filenames ("exedir",
	 and "tap_t"/"tap_tr" subfields). Uniform to this definition elsewhere too or use dynamic strings? (luigi).
	Changed strcmp to stricmp in main.c/get_exedir() to avoid issues under Windows when using 
	 TAB from command line with the -b option (ie. "Tapclean -b" did not work) (luigi).
	Changed the '\\', "\\", '/', "/" in main.c/get_exedir() to use the SLASH #definition (luigi).
	Fixed drag&drop feature in main.c/main(). If you use "tapclean -b", load_tap() doesn't
	 complain anymore (luigi).
	Partly Fixed the getcwd() call in batchscan.c/batchscan() to make room for appending the SLASH 
	 and '\0'. See the TODO document (luigi).
	Fixed the remaining-taps-counter in batchscan.c/batchscan() for batch scanning (luigi).

v0.03
	Split database operations into database.[c|h] (luigi+bgk).
	Fixed some off by one errors in main.c (luigi).
	Added build info + builder (luigi+bgk).
	Some more cleanup (bgk).

v0.02
	Added ODEload (slc+bgk).
	Added Cult loader (slc+bgk).
	Added 'clean.' to start of cleaned tap filename (bgk).
	Added -doprg parameter (bgk+peepo).

	Fixed bug in cbm_search (slc).

v0.01
	Cleanup of original FinalTAP console source (v2.76) (bgk).
