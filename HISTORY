	Moved au and wav filename definitions to the tap2audio.c file. Declaration is in tap2audio.h (Luigi)
	Removed drawwavesquare(), drawwavesine(), and s_out() prototypes from tap2audio.h, since those (PRIVATE)

	Converted "opname" in main.c/main() to a char *. No memory usage and no strcpy anymore (Luigi)
	Fixed "opnames[12][32]" that contains just 11 entries by converting it to "opnames[][32]" (Luigi)

	 initialized outside main() (Luigi)

	 and "wavoutname" in main.c to static const char (Luigi)

	Removed "tcreportname", "tcbatchreportname", "temptcbatchreportname", "tcinfoname", "auoutname",

	Removed duplicated BLKMAX, DBERR, and DBFULL #definitions from mydefs.h (Luigi)
	Added MAXPATH #definition in mydefs.h for strings holding path and some filenames ("exedir",
	 and "tap_t"/"tap_tr" subfields). Uniform to this definition elsewhere too or use dynamic strings? (Luigi)
	Changed strcmp to stricmp in main.c/get_exedir() to avoid issues under Windows when using 
	 TAB from command line with the -b option (ie. "Tapclean -b" did not work) (Luigi)
	Changed the '\\', "\\", '/', "/" in main.c/get_exedir() to use the SLASH #definition (Luigi)

	 complain anymore (Luigi)
	Partly Fixed the getcwd() call in batchscan.c/batchscan() to make room for appending the SLASH 
	 and '\0'. See the TODO document (Luigi)
