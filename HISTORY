v0.13
	Added 3 scanners: Rainbow Arts F1, R.A. F2, and Trilogic (luigi).

v0.12
	Added scanner for Alternative World Games (fabbo).

v0.11
	Additional fix inside audiogenic scanner (luigi).
	Fixed bleepload scanner.
	 The backtracing of pre-pilot pulses was missing a call to is_pause_param(). Mad Nurse now goes to 100% (luigi).
	Final revision of the accolade/ea scanner (luigi).
	Fixed is_pause_param() function in main.c.
	 The default return value did not work correctly at the very beginning of a TAP file. Boxing Manager now goes to 100% (luigi).
	Some fixes to Alien Syndrome scanner (fabbo)

v0.10
	Fixed audiogenic scanner.
	 The 0x01 byte after a block is NOT mandatory. This assumption was causing problems with Loopz (luigi).
	Fixed the 'trace eof' and 'addblockdef' issues in accolade_search().
	 The same should be done for all similiar scanners (luigi).
	Removed two levels of indentation inside accolade_search() (luigi).

v0.09
	added Accolade/EA (+clone) support (luigi).
	Added options for selecting c16, vic20 and c64 tapes.
	 No actual code support for c16 and vic20 YET. (bgk)

v0.08
	batchscan.c: Removed the "static const char tcbatchreportname[] = "tcbatch.txt";"
	 for it's already defined in main.c (luigi).
	database.c/.h: I moved here the prg-related functions (make_prgs() and save_prgs())
	 from main.c and added reset_prg_database() to remove code duplication in main() and save_prgs() (luigi).
	main.c: I changed many variables to static, improved the code within get_exedir() function.
	 Improved code in main() too: the variables now have the minimum required scope (luigi).
	mydefs.h: this file reflects the above changes and contains the new OSAPI_xxx definitions which avoid
	 the use of #ifdef WIN32 inside the whole code where system() is called (luigi).
	Expanded main.c:display_usage() (bgk)
	Added loader_id for Cult and removed for Alien Syndrome (bgk+luigi)

v0.07
	Converted scanners/usgold.c to new coding style (bgk)
	Updated Makefiles (bgk)
	Added support for Alien Syndrome loader. (fabbo)
	Updated Makefile (fabbo)

v0.06
	Files changed: batchscan.c, database.c, database.h, main.c, mydefs.h, tap2audio.h, tap2audio.c

	Reinserted "temptcbatchreportname" definition in main.c. It proves to be an useful indicator while the
	 bach scan is in progress. Declaration is _still_ in mydefs.h, it will be moved at a later time (luigi).
	Moved au and wav filename definitions to the tap2audio.c file. Declaration is in tap2audio.h (luigi).
	Removed drawwavesquare(), drawwavesine(), and s_out() prototypes from tap2audio.h, since those (PRIVATE)
	 functions are not used outside the tap2audio.c file, and therefore they were made static there (luigi).
	Added 1 level of indentation in main.c/main() for the TAP test (luigi).
	Removed duplication of forward declarations of addblockdef(); and sort_blocks(); in main.h (luigi).
	Changed many (PRIVATE) functions in main.c to static and commented out the declarations from main.h (luigi).
	Added #define HASNOTCHECKSUM -2 to database.h, thus eliminating the hardcoded value (luigi).
	Moved function scan_gaps() to the database module (luigi).
	Moved function count_rpulses() to the database module (luigi).
	Moved function count_good_checksums() to the database module (luigi).
	Moved function compute_overall_crc() to the database module (luigi).

v0.05
	Replace hardcoded values with #defines for read_errors[] (bgk)
	Added check for getcwd() returning NULL (bgk)
	Converted scanners/chr.c to new coding style (bgk)
	Converted scanners/pause.c to new coding style (bgk)
	Converted scanners/jetload.c to new coding style (bgk)
	Converted scanners/freeload.c to new coding style (bgk)
	Converted scanners/audiogenic.c to new coding style (bgk)

	Some small cleanups in filesearch.c (bgk)
	Removed global (FILE *fp) from tap2audio.c (bgk)
	Removed global (unsigned long bpos) from tap2audio.c (bgk)
	Removed last global (char *outbuf) from tap2audio.c (bgk)
	Removed 1 level of indentation in main.c::main() (bgk)
	Converted scanners/hitec.c to new coding style (bgk)
	Converted scanners/microload.c to new coding style (bgk)
	Some small cleanups in scanners/microload.c (bgk)
	Some small cleanups in scanners/hitec.c, freeload.c, jet.c (bgk)
	Some small cleanups in scanners/enigma.c, oceannew1t1.c (bgk)
	
v0.04
	Files changed: batchscan.c, database.c, main.c, mydefs.h.

	Converted "opname" in main.c/main() to a char *. No memory usage and no strcpy anymore (luigi).
	Fixed "opnames[12][32]" that contains just 11 entries by converting it to "opnames[][32]" (luigi).
	Removed duplicated initialization of "tol" and "debug" inside main.c/main(). They are akready
	 initialized outside main() (luigi).
	Fixed "create_database()" call in main.c/main() which was not checking for the return value (luigi).
	Added a freeing of allocated resources in database.c/create_database() in case of malloc() failure (luigi).
	Fixed wav_write() call in main.c/main() which was called using the au filename (luigi).
	Removed usage of "temptcreportname". Probably just useful in the GUI version of Final Tap (luigi).
	Converted "tcreportname", "tcbatchreportname", "temptcbatchreportname", "tcinfoname", "auoutname", 
	 and "wavoutname" in main.c to static const char (luigi).
	Converted "cleanedtapname" in main.c to static char (luigi).
	Removed "tcreportname", "tcbatchreportname", "temptcbatchreportname", "tcinfoname", "auoutname", 
	 "wavoutname", and "cleanedtapname" from mydefs.h. Just "exedir" (non-static) was kept (luigi).
	Removed duplicated BLKMAX, DBERR, and DBFULL #definitions from mydefs.h (luigi).
	Added MAXPATH #definition in mydefs.h for strings holding path and some filenames ("exedir",
	 and "tap_t"/"tap_tr" subfields). Uniform to this definition elsewhere too or use dynamic strings? (luigi).
	Changed strcmp to stricmp in main.c/get_exedir() to avoid issues under Windows when using 
	 TAB from command line with the -b option (ie. "Tapclean -b" did not work) (luigi).
	Changed the '\\', "\\", '/', "/" in main.c/get_exedir() to use the SLASH #definition (luigi).
	Fixed drag&drop feature in main.c/main(). If you use "tapclean -b", load_tap() doesn't
	 complain anymore (luigi).
	Partly Fixed the getcwd() call in batchscan.c/batchscan() to make room for appending the SLASH 
	 and '\0'. See the TODO document (luigi).
	Fixed the remaining-taps-counter in batchscan.c/batchscan() for batch scanning (luigi).

v0.03
	Split database operations into database.[c|h] (luigi+bgk).
	Fixed some off by one errors in main.c (luigi).
	Added build info + builder (luigi+bgk).
	Some more cleanup (bgk).

v0.02
	Added ODEload (slc+bgk).
	Added Cult loader (slc+bgk).
	Added 'clean.' to start of cleaned tap filename (bgk).
	Added -doprg parameter (bgk+peepo).
	Some more cleanups. Most of the scanner/* files remain for now (bgk).
	Fixed bug in cbm_search (slc).

v0.01
	Cleanup of original FinalTAP console source (v2.76) (bgk).
