- Moved au and wav filename definitions to the tap2audio.c file. Declaration is in tap2audio.h (Luigi)
- Removed `drawwavesquare()`, `drawwavesine()`, and `s_out()` prototypes from tap2audio.h, since those (PRIVATE) functions are not used outside the tap2audio.c file, and therefore they were made static there (Luigi)

Removed duplicated `BLKMAX`, `DBERR`, and `DBFULL` definitions from mydefs.h (Luigi)
Added `MAXPATH` definition in mydefs.h for strings holding path and some filenames (`exedir`, and `tap_t`/`tap_tr` subfields). Uniform to this definition elsewhere too or use dynamic strings? (Luigi)
Changed `strcmp` to `stricmp` in `get_exedir()` to avoid issues under Windows when using TAB from command line with the -b option (ie. "Tapclean -b" did not work) (Luigi)
