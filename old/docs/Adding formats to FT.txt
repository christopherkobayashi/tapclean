Adding new formats to Final TAP.



1. Write the new scanner file with functions 
   - xxx_search()
   - xxx_describe()
   
  +custom bit/byte reading functions if 'readttbit()' & 'readttbyte()' 
   cannot handle it.

   save your new format's source file in the 'scanners' folder and add 
   the function prototypes to 'scanners.h'


2. Add a definition for the format to the ft[] array. (in main file).

3. Add a capitalized constant name for the format to the enum in mydefs.h
   which should match the formats position in the ft[] array.

4. Add a function call to your xxx_search() to the search_tap() function in the
   main file.

5. Add a function call to your xxx_describe() to the describe_file() function
   in the main file.

6. Add a global variable 'noxxx' (allows disabling of the scanner) to the main 
   file and implement it as for all existing formats.

7. Test thoroughly!, be very careful that your newly added format does not
   conflict with any exisiting formats.



Adding Loader ID for quick scanning...

 Add the loader recognition CRC(s) to the 'loader_id.c' file, 
 +an entry in the mydefs.h enum of the form LID_XXX,
 +a format ID name in knam in the main file.

 Add a function call to your xxx_search() to the search_tap() function in the
 main file (the first part where loaders are ID tested).
