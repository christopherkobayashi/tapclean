CYBERLOAD FORMAT 3 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The loader is contained in the first F2 file. 

Files of this format will contain the actual game binaries, they are formatted as a 
sequence of sub-blocks, each one contains 256 bytes or less. 

Suprisingly they are NOT enciphered in any way. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Threshold : Varies between tapes.
Endianess : MSbF


Pilot byte : Varies between tapes (commonly $0F) (*8)
Sync byte : Varies between tapes (commonly $CC).

Then...

2 bytes : Load address (LSBF).
1 byte  : Data size (n), if $00 then n = 256.
1 byte  : Checkbyte (see notes below).
1 byte  : internal use.
1 byte  : internal use.
1 byte  : internal use.
1 byte  : internal use.
n bytes : Data. (n= 256 or less). 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:- 

Typically these sub-block files make up the majority of a tapes contents, there are usually 
a large number of them chained one after the other, sometimes they are seperated by pauses, 
sometimes not. 

The checkbyte in the header is the result of 0 XOR'ed with ALL bytes in the sub-block except 
itself.
