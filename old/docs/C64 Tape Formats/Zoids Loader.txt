ZOIDS LOADER 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This "artificial" loader includes three types of loaders and files:- 

- CBM tape blocks.
- Anirog tape block(s). (usually just one)
- Freeload blocks. (usually several of them). 

So far I have only found it in use on... Zoids (one release of 2), Uchi Mata (one release of 2).


Hint : the CBM files contain an Anirog tape loader... The Anirog tape file contains a 
Freeload loader, the Freeload blocks contain the game!.
