POWERLOAD 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can be found on... Felix in the factory, Ghouls, Jet Power Jack and some others. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Threshold : $0107 (263) clock cycles (TAP byte $21).
Bit 0 : $1C
Bit 1 : $29
Endianess : MSbF 
Pilot : $02 (*1043)
Sync : $09 down to $00

Then... 

n bytes : Data (I've yet to reliably compute the value of n, see notes.)
1 byte : Checksum (0 xor all 'n' data bytes) 



Notes:- 

Load address etc is stored in the loader program itself, here are the locations.. 

Load Address is at: $CE48,$CE4A (LSBF). 
End Address is at: $CE50,$CE52 (LSBF). 
Execution Address is at: $CF07,$CF08 (LSBF). 


There seems to be more data available than actually gets loaded, following all data 
bytes (including any unloaded data) is the XOR checkbyte, although this is not checked 
by the loader (for obvious reasons).
