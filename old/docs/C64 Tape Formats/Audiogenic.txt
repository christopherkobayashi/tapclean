Threshold : $013F (319) clock cycles (TAP byte $27).
Bit 0 : $1A
Bit 1 : $36
Endianess : MSbF
 
Pilot byte : $F0 (*4)
Sync byte : $AA 

Then...

1 byte    : Load Address MSB (low byte is always 00)
256 bytes : Data
1 byte    : Checksum (0 XOR all data bytes) 

Notes:- 

The files are typically chained one after another, each has pilot and sync but there 
is no pause between files of any single chain.

Tapes may contain several chains. 



The following file load addresses have special meaning to the loader...

0000 - loading stops after file is loaded and code is executed.
0100 - loading continues but the following data block needn't be consecutive.
0200 - loading stops after file is loaded and code is executed.
