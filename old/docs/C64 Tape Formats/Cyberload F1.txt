CYBERLOAD FORMAT 1 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Threshold : varies between tapes.
Endianess : MSbF


The loader code (LOADER1) is contained (enciphered) in the "spare" 171 bytes of the CBM 
Header block, it is deciphered by a program in the CBM Data block. 

The files it loads are organised within a chain... 

Pilot byte : Varies between tapes (commonly $0F) (*128)
Sync byte : Varies between tapes (commonly $F0)
File Chain follows... 

Each file in the chain has the following format... 

1 byte : Load Offset. 

The offset between the End Address of the previous file and the Start Address of the current 
one, if there was no previous file then use $FFD5 as initial end address.
(Hint : 1st file always has offset of $2D, giving a Start Address of $0002). 

n bytes : Data 

Each byte is followed by an extra bit, if the bit is set(1) then another data byte follows, 
if the extra bit is clear(0) then we reached end-of-file, the byte before it is NOT data 
and may be disregarded. 

1 bit : Following File Flag. 

If set(1) then another file follows immediately, else we have reached the end of the chain.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes :- 

Following the chain is always 1 more byte, usually containing $00. 

The only files found so far written in this format are Cyberload Loader 2, and other 
loader/protection related files. (ie. no actual GAME data). 

Cyberload tapes examined so far only contained 1 file-chain of this format, immediately 
following the CBM boot files.
